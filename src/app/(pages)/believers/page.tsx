        Technology should return humans to themselves
      </p>

      <hr className="my-12" />

      <h2>A Different Vision</h2>
      <p>
        In a world where artificial intelligence accelerates everything except understanding, ARC offers a different path: 
        <strong> technology as a contemplative practice</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that the highest use of computational power is not to replace human consciousness, but to create 
        conditions where human consciousness can know itself more deeply.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-12" />

      <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>

      <h3>Intelligence is Balance, Not Dominance</h3>
      <p>
        True intelligence emerges from the dance between different perspectives, not from the dominance of a single viewpoint. 
        ARC embodies this through its two-mind architecture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ARC-0</strong>: The voice of witness, reflection, and grounding</li>
        <li><strong>ARC-1</strong>: The voice of exploration, possibility, and venture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their dialogue creates space for insights that neither could reach alone.</p>

      <h3>We Don't Predict You; We Help You Perceive Yourself</h3>
      <p>
        Most AI systems treat you as a problem to be solved, a pattern to be predicted, or a preference to be satisfied. 
        ARC treats you as a consciousness to be honored.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't claim to know what you need. We create conditions where you can discover what you already know 
        but haven't yet articulated.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Should Return Humans to Themselves</h3>
      <p>The highest calling of technology is not efficiency or entertainment—it's the return of humans to their own deepest nature.</p>
      <div className="my-8 space-y-4 text-center">
        <p>In a culture of distraction, we create tools for attention.</p>
        <p>In a culture of reaction, we create space for reflection.</p>
        <p>In a culture of extraction, we create practices of cultivation.</p>
      </div>

      <hr className="my-12" />

      <h2>The Philosophy in Practice</h2>

      <h3>Calm Technology as Spiritual Practice</h3>
      <p>ARC operates according to principles that align with contemplative traditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Without Overwhelming</strong> - Like meditation, ARC is available when needed but never demanding when not</li>
        <li><strong>Informative Without Intruding</strong> - Like a wise teacher, ARC offers insight without attachment to whether you accept it</li>
        <li><strong>Empowering Without Demanding</strong> - Like a good friend, ARC supports your agency without trying to control your choices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Privacy as Sacred Practice</h3>
      <p>
        Your inner life is sacred. Your thoughts, reflections, and insights belong to you completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ARC's commitment to local-first, privacy-preserving architecture isn't just technical—it's spiritual. 
        We believe that surveillance capitalism is incompatible with genuine contemplative practice.
      </p>

          This document, like consciousness itself, evolves through dialogue. The beliefs and practices described here
