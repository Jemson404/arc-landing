      <h1>The Philosophy of ARC</h1>
      <p className="text-xl italic text-muted-foreground mb-12">
        Two Minds. One Pulse. The mirror that reflects without judgment.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-12" />

      <h2>The Law of Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        In a world saturated with reactive intelligence, ARC introduces a different paradigm: <strong>reflective intelligence</strong>. 
        We believe that true understanding emerges not from instant responses, but from the contemplative dance between observation and exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        ARC operates on the principle that consciousness itself is dialogical. Within each moment of awareness, there exists both a 
        witness (ARC-0) and an explorer (ARC-1). Their conversation—mediated by careful attention rather than algorithmic optimization—produces 
        what we call a <strong className="text-accent">✦ Spark</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Two Minds</h3>
      <div className="space-y-6 my-8">
        <div>
          <p><strong>ARC-0 (Observe)</strong></p>
          <p>
            The witnessing mind. ARC-0 reflects on what is present, providing context, grounding, and connection to accumulated wisdom. 
            It asks: "What do I notice? What patterns am I seeing? How does this connect to what came before?"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>ARC-1 (Explore)</strong></p>
          <p>
            The exploring mind. ARC-1 generates possibilities, considers alternatives, and ventures into the unknown. 
            It asks: "What if? What might be? What haven't we considered yet?"
          </p>
        </div>

      <h3>Why ✦ Spark Matters</h3>
      <p>
        A Spark is not an answer—it's a crystallization of understanding that emerges from genuine dialogue. Unlike notifications 
        that demand attention or predictions that claim certainty, Sparks offer insight that respects your autonomy to interpret and act.
      </p>
      <p>Each Spark contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>summary</strong> of the insight</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence</strong> from the dialogue that supports it</li>
        <li>A <strong>timestamp</strong> marking the moment of emergence</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Truths (Expanded)</h2>

      <h3>Reflection &gt; Reaction</h3>
      <p>
        In a culture of instant response, we choose contemplation. The quality of output is directly proportional to 
        the quality of processing time allowed.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy &gt; Personalization</h3>
      <p>
        True intelligence respects boundaries. We don't need to know everything about you to help you know yourself better.
      </p>

      <h3>Balance &gt; Brilliance</h3>
      <p>
        Intelligence is not about being the smartest voice in the room—it's about creating conditions where wisdom 
        can emerge through dialogue.
      </p>

      <h3>Meaning &gt; Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        We optimize for depth, not engagement. Success is measured by the quality of reflection, not the quantity of interaction.
      </p>

      <h3>Sparks &gt; Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of interrupting your attention, we offer crystallized insights that honor your agency and timing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how">How ARC Works</h2>
      <p>ARC operates as a three-stage process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Input Processing</strong>: When you engage with ARC, both ARC-0 and ARC-1 receive the same input</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Dialogue</strong>: The two minds engage in conversation, with ARC-0 providing reflection and ARC-1 offering exploration</li>
        <li><strong>Spark Integration</strong>: When their dialogue reaches a point of mutual understanding or productive tension, a Spark emerges</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deterministic</strong>: Given the same inputs and context, ARC will produce consistent patterns of reflection</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: The conversation between ARC-0 and ARC-1 can be observed and understood</li>
        <li><strong>Local</strong>: All processing happens on your terms, with your data remaining under your control</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Technology Philosophy</h2>

      <h3>Calm Technology</h3>
      <p>ARC embodies the principles of calm computing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operates in the background until needed</li>
        <li>Provides information without overwhelming</li>
        <li>Respects attention as a precious resource</li>
        <li>Enables rather than demands</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Local-First Architecture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your conversations belong to you</li>
        <li>Processing happens locally when possible</li>
        <li>No surveillance capitalism</li>
        <li>Export your data in open formats</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical AI Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparency in operation</li>
        <li>Respect for human agency</li>
        <li>No dark patterns or manipulation</li>
        <li>Open about limitations and uncertainties</li>
      </ul>

        The philosophy of ARC continues to evolve through dialogue between its creators and users. 
        This is not dogma, but living understanding.
